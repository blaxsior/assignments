I know a young man who declares that after reading a certain
explorer’s description of a journey across the burning Sahara, he
found to his amazement that his nose was covered with freckles. The
reader will perhaps remember how, on some rainy day in his childhood,
he has sat over the fire and has read sea-stories and dreamed
sea-dreams until his lips, he will swear, have tasted salt. Alas,
one’s little agility in the art of narration is wholly inadequate
for the production, at this time of life, of any such phenomena
upon the gentle skins of those who chance to read these pages. Were
one a master-maker of literature, one might herewith lead the
imaginative so straight into the boisterous breezes of Egypt, one
might hold them so entranced in the sunlight which streams over
the desert, that they would feel, wherever they might be seated,
the tingling glow of the sun and the wind upon their cheeks,
and would hold their hands to their eyes as a shelter from the
glare. The walls of their rooms would fall flat as those of Jericho;
and outside they would see the advancing host of the invaders—the
sunshine, the north wind, the scudding clouds, the circling eagles,
the glistening sand, the blue shadows, and the rampant rocks. And
the night closing over the sack of their city, they would see the
moonlight, the brilliant stars, the fluttering bats, the solemn owls;
and they would hear the wailing of the hyænas and the barking of
the dogs in the distant camps. If one only possessed the ability,
one might weave such a magic carpet for those who knew how to ride
upon it, that, deserting the fallen Jericho of their habitation,
they would fly to the land of the invaders which they had seen,
and there they would be kept as spell-bound and dazzled by the eyes
of the wilderness as ever a child was dazzled by a tale of the sea.
It's beautiful!
