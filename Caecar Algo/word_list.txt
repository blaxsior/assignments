President Joe Biden told reporters Tuesday he’s concerned about Russia's plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in neighboring Belarus.
“They haven’t done that yet, unless something happened while I was on the helicopter,” Biden said. “Sure, I’m concerned about that.” 
“What’ve I been talking to you guys about for the last year? This is dangerous kind of talk, and it’s worrisome,” Biden added.
On Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. Moscow will complete the construction of a special storage facility for tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus by the beginning of July, Putin told state broadcaster Russia 1.
Former Vice President Mike Pence also weighed in Tuesday on Putin's plans.
"Every time he gets into a corner, he mentions nuclear weapons, and now the threat about moving tactical weapons is just the latest,” Pence said of Putin Tuesday during an interview with Newsmax.
He argued it's “absolutely essential that we continue to give Ukraine what they need."
"We don't allow Putin to distract the world or diminish support through his threats of moving tactical nuclear weapons," Pence said. "We just need to remain strong and stand with the Ukrainians.” 
The situation in the contested eastern city of Bakhmut remains "under control," with the commander of the country's ground forces taking control of the city's defense, the Ukrainian military said.
The military also said in an update Tuesday that the heaviest combat is concentrated in several zones in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and its units have repelled the latest efforts by Russian forces to advance. Over the last day, the General Staff said it repelled 24 Russian attacks.
Here are other headlines:
International assistance: Britain and Poland on Tuesday announced plans to build two temporary villages in Ukraine with housing for people who have been forced to flee their homes due to Russia’s invasion. And on Tuesday, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said the government will receive an additional $2.5 billion from the US as a grant to help with state services such as salaries and benefits. The budgetary support is part of a US pledge of $9.9 billion to assist the Ukrainian economy in 2023 and is separate from military assistance. 
Olympic developments: The International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) executive board on Tuesday issued a recommendation to international federations and international sports event organizers that athletes “who actively support the war cannot compete.” But earlier on Tuesday, IOC President Thomas Bach defended plans to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in international competitions. 
Military defense increases: The Russian Defense Ministry said Tuesday the production of individual types of ammunition will increase seven to eight times by the end of the year. But Western analysts have expressed skepticism that Russia’s military-industrial capacity and supply chains can be accelerated so quickly. In Ukraine, the government announced Tuesday that three new companies financed by donations are ready to deploy Ukrainian-made drones for combat.
Data decisions: The US decided Tuesday to not share data under a key nuclear arms control treaty in response to Russia's announcement that it will not do so either. Meanwhile, the US decision to fly its surveillance drones further south over the Black Sea after a Russian jet collided with a US drone earlier this month “definitely limits our ability to gather intelligence” related to the Ukraine war, a senior US military official tells CNN.
Military action is increasing around Zaporizhzhia’s nuclear power plant, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi said Tuesday.
Speaking from Dnipro in Ukraine, ahead of a visit to the plant, Grossi said the situation “is not getting any better."
"Military action continues," he told CNN’s Lynda Kinkade. "In fact, it is increasing. There are growing numbers of troops, and military vehicles, heavy artillery, more military action around the plant.” 
The power plant has been “in blackout repeatedly,” Grossi added.
The director general's visit will be his second to the plant and his first since the IAEA established a permanent presence at the site in September last year, the agency said in a statement Saturday.
“I want to see what the situation is for myself, talk to the management there, which is the Russian management," Grossi told CNN.
Russia's state-owned nuclear energy monopoly, Rosatom, said Tuesday that Russia is ready to discuss the situation at the plant with the head of the IAEA.
“In a few hours myself and my team, we are going to cross the front line again – as we did last year,” Grossi said. “I am going to continue my consultations in order to try to establish a protection around the plant and spare us all from a nuclear accident with potential catastrophic consequences.”
The IAEA chief said the current risk level at the plant is “extremely high and it’s totally unpredictable, precisely because we are in a combat zone.”
On Monday, Grossi met with President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was visiting the Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro regions. Later, in his nightly address on Monday, Zelensky thanked Grossi for his support.

The Ukrainian government announced that three new companies financed by donations are ready to deploy Ukrainian-made drones for combat.
Mykhailo Fedorov, the vice prime minister for innovations, development of education, science and technology, said that the creation of the drone companies would bring “a completely new approach to management, training and doctrine of drone usage.”
Fedorov said the companies will have pickup trucks, attack helicopters and Starlink terminals. All the drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles, are made in Ukraine. 
“The drones will perform reconnaissance and strike missions. They will be used to guide artillery, help soldiers to be as effective as possible during urban battles and save lives,” Fedorov said. “The pickup trucks will be used for raids by mobile groups into enemy territory, delivery of cargo and evacuation of the wounded.”
Drones have played a substantial role – in both attack and reconnaissance modes – for the Ukrainian forces over the past year.
Fedorov said the equipment was purchased by private donors.
More than $1.5 million was raised through the sale of 100,000 packets containing salt from a mine at Soledar, a town that was captured by fighters of the Russian private military company Wagner in January.
Soldiers of a Russian army unit who complained to President Vladimir Putin about their “criminal” commanders and being forced into suicidal combat situations are now under interrogation by the military prosecutor’s office, according to an independent Russian media outlet, ASTRA.
ASTRA said it had spoken with relatives of the men, who serve with the Storm detachment of a brigade of the 8th Russian army. 
Last week, the men stated in a video that they had been confined in trenches in the village of Vodiane near Donetsk. They were subsequently sent to Donetsk, according to ASTRA. 
Two of the units have vanished and “have allegedly already been put on the wanted list as having left the unit without permission,” ASTRA says, quoting relatives of the soldiers.
The video message last week, addressed to Putin, showed about 20 men of the Storm detachment who said men were thrown into trenches “littered with corpses."
They also claimed in the video that “barrier troops” -- which are also known as troops that prevent any unit from retreating -- “were put up against us and did not let us leave our positions. Now they don’t let us go anywhere at all, they promise to destroy us," the soldiers said. "We are in danger."
“They are threatening to destroy us one by one and as a unit," one soldier added. "They want to execute us as witnesses of a completely negligent criminal leadership.”
“Our leadership decided to direct us at machine guns, mortars, tanks," the unit’s commander said in the video. "We sat under open fire from mortars and artillery for 14 days. 34 people injured, 22 killed. Our company commander was killed.”
The soldiers said they had never seen their leadership or official orders. “The leadership of the fifth brigade is a criminal group,” one said.
The Ukrainian military says the situation in Bakhmut remains “under control” – with the commander of the country’s ground forces taking control of the city’s defense. 
The Ukrainian Land Forces, in a Facebook post, said Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi “is constantly on the front line with his subordinate units. Together with their commanders, they coordinate actions that will prevent the enemy from realizing their plans.”
“The enemy continues to try to break through our defenses around the town and sends its best units there.”
An unofficial Telegram channel of the soldiers of the 46th separate airmobile brigade said that the defense of the city relied upon holding the village of Ivanivske, a few kilometers to the west.
"The surrender of Ivanivske would dramatically worsen the situation in the area of the (Bakhmut) Airplane [a monument in the south of the city],” it said.
Losing Ivanivske would also yield “physical control over the road to Chasiv Yar,” it said, and would “allow our rear and flank to be attacked from the south.”
The Telegram channel added: “Despite the increase in the intensity of artillery and air support for the Wagnerites, it is noticeable that the orcs [Russians] have not had any success for several days.”
“[Their] tactical advances are minimal, despite the intensity of the fighting.”
 A major in the Bakhmut area, Makysm Zhorin, said on Telegram late Tuesday that “Bakhmut has been shelled all day long.”
“As before, the biggest pressure is inflicted on the residential areas. Our guys are fighting for every house, but it is very difficult to hold back so many occupiers. The flanks are holding, no one is letting the Russians surround the city.”
The United States announced it supports the creation of a special tribunal to prosecute the crime of aggression — a significant development in the push to hold top Kremlin officials accountable for the war in Ukraine.
"At this critical moment in history, I am pleased to announce that the United States supports the development of an internationalized tribunal dedicated to prosecuting the crime of aggression against Ukraine," US Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice Beth Van Schaack announced Monday.
The announcement of US support for the development of such a body "in the form of an internationalized court that is rooted in Ukraine's judicial system, with international elements," in the words of a US State Department spokesperson, comes after Ukraine and other countries have for months pushed for the creation of the mechanism. 
Some more context: Although there are a number of different bodies like the International Criminal Court (ICC) which can prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity, they do not have the ability to prosecute the crime of aggression.
As such, Ukrainian Ambassador-at-Large Anton Korynevych in December argued that these existing mechanisms do not do enough to ensure that the decision-makers in Moscow face punishment for their war against Ukraine.
"We have a loophole, a gap in accountability, when we talk about accountability for the crime of aggression against Ukraine," Korynevych told CNN in Washington, DC, at the time. 
"Legally, currently, there is no international mechanism, which can investigate and prosecute the crime of aggression against Ukraine," he explained.

The Ukrainian military said in an update Tuesday that the heaviest combat is concentrated in several zones in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions – and that its units have repelled the latest efforts by Russian forces to advance.
The General Staff said “the towns of Bilohorivka, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Mariinka and their outskirts remain at the epicenter of the fighting" and that Ukrainian Defense Forces "repelled 24 enemy attacks in the above areas over the last day."
“In the Bakhmut sector, the enemy continues to assault the city of Bakhmut. However, our defenders are bravely holding the city and repelling numerous enemy attacks," it said.
Russian forces control access to both Bakhmut and Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine on three sides. They have made marginal gains in recent weeks but have been unable to encircle Ukrainian troops in either place. Most of the eastern front lines have changed little in the first three months of the year.
Away from the Donbas area, the General Staff said that a missile strike on the town of Bohodukhiv in Kharkiv region had injured civilians and damaged houses.
What Ukraine says is happening in other areas: The military said Russian forces had continued to fire across the border at settlements in the northern Sumy region, as well as at towns and villages in the Kharkiv region. 
The General Staff also said that Russian forces – while on the defensive on the southern Zaporizhzhia front – had fired at a number of settlements. 
It said that the Ukrainian air force had carried out “five strikes on the areas of concentration of occupiers' personnel and military equipment over the day. Missile and artillery units hit a command post, an area where enemy manpower, weapons and military equipment were concentrated, and an ammunition depot.”
Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said the government will receive an additional $2.5 billion from the United States as a grant to help with state services such as salaries and benefits.
The budgetary support is part of a US pledge of $9.9 billion to assist the Ukrainian economy in 2023 and is separate from military assistance. 
Shmyhal said the funds would come through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Development Association.
He said the aid would be used “to pay salaries to our rescuers, teachers, doctors, to help pensioners, internally displaced persons, people with disabilities and low-income families.”
More on US aid to Ukraine: The US disbursement is part of a broad international program of support for the Ukrainian economy. Shmyhal noted that since the beginning of the year, Ukraine had obtained almost $5 billion in support from the EU and more than $2 billion from the United States. There is also a new package of assistance agreed with the IMF of $15.6 billion.
"We received financial assistance from Great Britain, the World Bank, Germany, Spain, Finland, Ireland, Switzerland, Belgium, Iceland, and Estonia. Norway has extended the program of payments for 50,000 Ukrainians who are facing difficult living conditions and have suffered from Russian aggression," Shmyhal said.
In February, the United States began disbursing $9.9 billion in direct budget support to the government of Ukraine. The grant announced Tuesday is the second installment. Last year, the US provided $13 billion in budget support.
Ukraine has forecast a budget deficit of $36 billion in 2023, with almost all government revenue being devoted to the war effort.
Russian video claiming to show Ukrainian military intimidating woman and child revealed as fake 
From Gianluca Mezzofiore and Josh Pennington
A Russian propaganda video purportedly showing the Ukrainian military firing at a car with a mother and child after hearing the woman speaking Russian has been debunked as fake, a CNN analysis shows. 
The staged footage starts with a man wearing a Ukrainian military uniform stopping the car for “violating traffic rules” before telling the woman in the car: “Scumbag, give me your documents.”
After hearing the woman speak Russian, the man in uniform calls her a “pig, stupid scumbag” and fires several rounds with his rifle, scaring the child in the car. Both the woman and the child can be heard screaming. 
The dashcam video was shared widely on Russian Telegram accounts and even on official Twitter accounts, such as the Russian ministry of foreign affairs and the Russian embassy in London. 
However, open-source analysts on Twitter (@Tatarigami_UA, @PStyle0ne1 and @EjShahid) geolocated the footage as well within Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine’s Donetsk region.  
A CNN analysis confirmed the location as on the outskirts of the city of Makiivka, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the front line.
Local people even went to the site and took a picture of the tree branches, which have a distinctive shape, further corroborating the geolocation of the video.
A pro-Russia Telegram channel with more than subscribers, Veteran Notes, admitted that the video is fake. 
"This video is fake. This was a botched exercise. We still have a lot to learn about such information operations," it posted.
After being debunked by the open source community, Russia’s official ministry of foreign affairs Twitter account took down the video, without acknowledging the incident was fabricated.

The International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) executive board on Tuesday issued a recommendation to international federations and international sports event organizers that athletes “who actively support the war cannot compete.”
The IOC executive board issued the following six points in its recommendation today, including that athletes with a Russian or a Belarusian passport "must compete only as Individual Neutral Athletes" and "teams of athletes with a Russian or Belarusian passport cannot be considered."
The recommendation also says that "sanctions against those responsible for the war, the Russian and Belarusian states and governments, must remain in place."
IOC President Thomas Bach had said the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in 2024 Olympics was "not considered" during the Tuesday meeting.
Earlier on Tuesday, Bach had defended plans to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in international competitions.
The IOC’s executive board will also be meeting Wednesday and Thursday.
More than 300 active and former fencers wrote the IOC Tuesday urging the organization to uphold sanctions against Russian and Belarusian athletes, saying that allowing them entry back into international competitions would be “a catastrophic error."
More on the IOC's stance: In February 2022, the IOC executive board recommended that International Sports Federations and sports event organizers "not invite or allow the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials in international competitions.”
But in January 2023, the IOC outlined a multi-step plan for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate at the upcoming 2024 Summer Games in Paris and the 2026 Winter Games in Milan, which was met by criticism from the United States, Canada and several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland.
Russian and Belarusian athletes have been competing as neutrals in some international competitions.

Russia will not provide the United States with data on its nuclear forces that is shared semi-annually under a key nuclear arms control treaty, and in response, the US will not do so either, a top Pentagon official and a National Security Council spokesperson said Tuesday.  
Moscow’s move not to provide the information comes after President Vladimir Putin suspended Russia’s participation in the New START Treaty, the only bilateral agreement left between the world’s two largest nuclear powers. The US has strongly condemned Russia’s suspension, which the NSC spokesperson called “legally invalid.”
“Yesterday, we had a further interaction with Russia, pressing them on the upcoming end of the month, there is due a semiannual data exchange every six months, under the treaty, we exchange data on kind of high-level numbers,” Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy John Plumb said at a House Armed Services subcommittee hearing. 
“Russia responded that they will not be providing that information,” he said. “And so as a diplomatic countermeasure, the United States will not be providing that information back.”
“We are going to continue to examine what are the diplomatic countermeasures [that] are appropriate,” Plumb said. “What we're trying to do, sir, is balance both responding to Russia's irresponsible behavior but to continue to demonstrate what we believe a responsible nuclear power’s action should be.”
The NSC spokesperson described the decision not to provide data in response to Russia’s action “as a lawful countermeasure intended to encourage Russia to return to compliance with the treaty,” and noted that “Russia’s failure to exchange this data will…be a violation of the treaty, adding on to its existing violations of the New START Treaty.”
“In the interest of strategic stability, the United States will continue to promote public transparency on our nuclear force levels and posture,” the NSC spokesperson said.
The Russian Defense Ministry said on Tuesday that the production of individual types of ammunition will increase seven to eight times by the end of the year.
Western analysts have expressed skepticism that Russia’s military-industrial capacity and supply chains can be accelerated so quickly.
It made the announcement as Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu toured enterprises in the Chelyabinsk and Kirov regions. The ministry issued video of Shoigu at a factory making large-caliber ammunition and shells. 
The Defense Ministry said that projects were being implemented to modernize and expand production capacities, as well as increase labor productivity.
It said this would increase production “to meet the needs of the Russian troops, and by the end of this year, the production of individual product samples will increase seven- to eight-fold.”
On Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview with Russian state TV that the Russian defense industry is "developing at a very fast pace" and would produce three times more ammunition than is being supplied to Ukraine by "the igniters of conflict."
The US decision to fly its surveillance drones further south over the Black Sea after a Russian jet collided with a US drone earlier this month “definitely limits our ability to gather intelligence” related to the Ukraine war, a senior US military official tells CNN.
Flying drones at greater distances reduces the quality of intelligence they can gather, a US military official explained, noting that spy satellites can compensate to some degree but have shorter times over targets, again reducing effectiveness relative to surveillance drones. 
After the Russian jet collided with a US Reaper drone earlier this month, the US began flying its surveillance drones further south and at a higher altitude over the Black Sea than previously, placing them further away from airspace surrounding the Crimean Peninsula and eastern portions of the Black Sea.  
When CNN first reported this change, one US official said the new routes were part of an effort “to avoid being too provocative,” as the Biden administration continues to be careful to avoid any incident that could escalate into a direct conflict with Russian forces. The official said the drone flights would continue this way “for the time being,” but added there is already “an appetite” to return to the routes closer to Russian-held territory.
Asked about the new routes’ impact on intelligence gathering, Pentagon spokesperson Gen. Patrick Ryder told CNN that they are "not going to discuss missions, routes, or timing of operations. We're also not going to discuss intelligence operations other than to say we maintain a robust ISR capability in the region and beyond.” 
A spokesperson for the National Security Council referred questions to the Pentagon.
More on the US routes: In the wake of the collision with the US MQ-9 Reaper drone on March 14, US officials have repeatedly said that the US would continue to fly in international airspace. However, the new routes place those flights more than forty nautical miles from the Ukrainian coast, rather than the 12 nautical miles normally recognized as the limit of a nation’s airspace. 
According to a senior US military official, there is concern that once the US has moved its flight routes away from areas closer to the Ukraine coast, it will be harder to return to them and assert freedom of flight for US aircraft. The US Navy has not sailed into the Black Sea since December 2021.
The downing of the drone marked the first time Russian and US military aircraft had come into direct physical contact since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine.

AI (or artificial intelligence) imaging tools are becoming ever more sophisticated. The technology, which generates pictures based on users' text prompts, has been used to design inclusive fashion shows, create entire graphic novels, and even help envision new forms of architecture. But as AI develops and computer-generated "deep fake" imagery grows more convincing, many are concerned about the ethical implications, including the removal of subjects' agency (placing people in fabricated scenarios that may be defamatory or malicious, for example) and whether machine learning technology will one day make fake news indiscernible.
Just last week, AI-generated photos of Donald Trump being arrested spread like wildfire after the former president wrote on social media that he was expecting to be indicted in connection with a campaign finance investigation in New York. (Trump, who maintains his innocence, has yet to be charged on any counts.)
AI and the future of fashion
If dressing is an important form of self-expression, then an AI-generated outfit might not only diminish the power and messaging inherent in clothes — but a person's autonomy. In the papacy, each garment holds religious significance. The color of the Pope's vestments is specially selected to align with specific celebrations: red can only be worn during specific occasions, such as Palm Sunday, Good Friday and Pentecost, because it represents the blood of Jesus Christ, while pink is worn just twice a year. As such, fake images of the Pope wearing certain clothes outside these — or in countless other — contexts could cause offense, alarm or even mistrust within the Catholic community.
Digitally altering someone's outfit could have a lasting reputational damage, too. A doctored 2005 photo that appeared to show Paris Hilton at a nightclub wearing an inflammatory tank top that read "Stop Being Poor" became one of the most recognizable pop culture images of the early aughts. It added to the public perception of Hilton as an out-of-touch heiress. She publicly addressed the fake image in 2021, insisting people shouldn't "believe everything you read." (The vest, a which came from a fashion collection designed by Hilton's sister, Nicky, actually read "Stop Being Desperate.")
During a conference at the Vatican on Monday, Pope Francis addressed the emergence of AI technology and urged scientists to consider its human impact (though he did not specifically reference the furor over his own appearance being faked). "I am convinced that the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning has the potential to contribute in a positive way to the future of humanity," Francis said, before adding: "I am certain that this potential will be realized only if there is a constant and consistent commitment on the part of those developing these technologies to act ethically and responsibly."

"I would therefore encourage you, in your deliberations, to make the intrinsic dignity of every man and woman the key criterion in evaluating emerging technologies," said Francis. "These will prove ethically sound to the extent that they help respect that dignity and increase its expression at every level of human life."
